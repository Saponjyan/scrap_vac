We're hiring a Senior Software Engineer for Web/Mobile to join our Engineering team.Oscar is the first health insurance company built around a full stack technology platform and a relentless focus on serving our members. We started Oscar in 2012 to create the kind of health insurance company we would want for ourselves—one that behaves like a doctor in the family.About This RoleAs a Senior Software Engineer, you'll join a tight knit, passionate team, and lead the designs of Oscar's next generation of complex, feature rich, business services, data pipelines and architecture, and scalable infrastructure. You'll mentor engineers to help them design for stability, performance, and scalability across services or clients.We take pride in our efforts (deploys > 100/day), our small teams (engineers <= 5), and our ambition (frequency == everyday).You will report into a leader on the Engineering team. This is a hybrid role. You will work part of the time in the New York City office and part of the time work-from-home/remote.The base pay for this role is: $156,560 - $205,485 per year. You are also eligible for employee benefits, company equity grants and annual performance bonuses.What We're DoingDoctor on Call – Whenever possible, we want members to start their care with us. Central to this experience is Doctor on Call: unlimited, 24/7 access to a doctor that's completely free for most members and accessible directly in the website or mobile app. We're able to resolve around two-thirds of all requests, often averting a more expensive trip to the emergency room or urgent care.Appointment Scheduling – Finding a doctor and scheduling an appointment shouldn't require calling up every doctor in the directory. We've partnered with select doctors to reserve appointment slots for Oscar members, and it's just a few clicks for our members to find the right doctor, view their availabilities, and immediately book an appointment.Cost Estimates – One of the biggest issues for members is price transparency. It's difficult to find out how much something in healthcare will cost beforehand. in a different location can result in a difference in costs. We're building a cost estimates tool for members so they can get accurate price estimates for the service they're planning on receiving. This will help our members make informed decisions and avoid surprise medical bills.Broker Platform – We are working to arm our brokers with the tools they need to support their clients and make sure that they use the tools that Oscar has to offer. As our partners, we want to ensure that brokers have an understanding of our plans, and that they can experience the Oscar tech that sets us apart first-hand. In their web-based accounts, they can sign up to sell Oscar, enroll new members, manage their existing book of business, and see their commission payments.Knowledge Management – Our Concierge Care Guides field thousands of questions every day from our members, ranging from payments to benefits to help with finding a doctor. They essentially have to become experts on everything. We're creating a platform that automatically surfaces relevant answers based on the member's inquiries, ensuring the content is specific to the member and their plan and demographics.Component Library – Part of what makes Oscar stand out is having visually appealing and easy to understand user experiences. We've designed and built a React component library that's branded and web accessible. Every web application at Oscar, whether external or internal, uses the component library.

The current healthcare experience is broken: it's expensive, confusing, and doesn't focus enough on patient outcomes. Our goal is to refactor healthcare piece by piece.An eagerness to collaborate with other engineers, product managers, designers, and operational partners across Oscar. We believe the best ideas emerge when people share different perspectives and work together.Experience understanding our problems and user requirements and translating them into solutions.The ability to architect creative and maintainable applications across our web and mobile clients. We seek the right balance between moving quickly and improving the operability, performance, and scalability of the systems we build.An interest in using the best tool for the job.

We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.YOUR TEAM In Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, an accurate representation of the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.The PDK team is responsible for building the application to support user driven configuration of the Nuna Value Platform. This encompasses building the user interfaces, the APIs, and database schemas to manage the content that powers our apps. We work with Nuna’s Data Platform teams, integrating with large datasets and rules engines to allow our users to configure, execute, review and publish their healthcare programs.We are building for the long term with a focus on increasing engineer velocity across Nuna by maintaining standardized development and deployment infrastructure. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and infrastructure that is secure-by-default.YOUR IMPACTThe PDK team is building the future of how our users work with Nuna - evolving from a long, error-prone human intensive process to a fast systematic way of deploying and managing the healthcare programs that drive our customer’s businesses. We measure our products’ success by the quality and iterative speed it provides to our customers. As an engineering-led culture, you will be at the vanguard of making healthcare work for all Americans. Today, you’ll be helping hospitals improve quality of care and enabling health plans to pay for quality-of-care not quantity-of-care. Tomorrow, you’ll be creating even bigger and better products to shape this industry.Tech Lead Managers have not only the technical expertise to take on and provide technical leadership to major projects, but also manage a team of engineers. You not only optimize your own code but make sure engineers are able to optimize theirs. As a SWE Manager you manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy and help develop your team.YOUR OPPORTUNITIESYou’ll build products that change the dynamics and incentives of the healthcare industry, changing a zero-sum game of competition between payers and providers into patient-centered collaboration.You’ll manage and grow small team of engineers, and collaborate closely with the platform engines teamYou’ll provide technical vision and strategy for your teamYou’ll design APIs and service architectures that multiply the effectiveness of internal and external developers serving millions of patients.You’ll work in our high stakes production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security.You’ll identify big opportunities to improve our technology and our products, blazing trails through ambiguity.You’ll mentor more junior engineers and, in turn, learn from others, because we are learners, not knowers, and growing Nuna’s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.You’ll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting othersYOU BRINGAs a full stack engineering team, we need a wide array of skills as a whole.
